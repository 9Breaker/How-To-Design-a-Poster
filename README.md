## How to use this guide
This guide is mainly targetted towards users who are looking to publicise an event or activity through the use of posters. If you belong to a student organisation, Fifth Row or any other relevant parties, this is the guide for you!

## Steps
1. Identify what the purpose/event is. It can include competitions, talks or workshops. Basically whatever your event is supposed to be.
2. Get all the information required to be on the poster. You can get this by attending meetings with the organising team/exco, or by contacting someone who is in the loop.
3. Collate the information to simplify your process later. Information can include:
   - Date of event (*start and end, if applicable*)
   - Location(s) of event
   - Time/duration/length of event (*start and end, if applicable*)
   - Cost (*and when and where to pay*)
   - Pre-requisites (*software, equipment, knowledge etc*)
   - Prizes (*if applicable*)
   - Website/email/social media links and content(*if applicable*)
4. Start working on your poster. Usually software from Adobe Creative Cloud is used, such as Illustrator or Photoshop. Adobe CC is availble for free to all SUTD students. The files can be found at the SUTD downloads website (http://downloads.sutd.edu.sg).
5. Create your poster. Use online resources and tutorials to find out how to create a good poster.
6. Constantly send your draft to be vetted by your organisation to keep receiving points to improve on.
7. Once your organisation is satisfied with your output, you are done!
## Stakeholders
- Your organisation (Fifth Rows, UROPs etc)
- SUTD Community

## Things to look out for
- To access your SUTD downloads account, use the same login ID and password that you use for eDimension (ID: SUTDSTU\100XXXX, PW:XXXXXXX).
- All posters to be displayed are to be the standard A4 size (210x297mm).
- Use relevant colours to your event to catch other people's attention.
- Ensure there is sufficient contrast between your words and background so that it becomes easy for your audience to read.
- Poster should include a contact person in case of any queries.
- A poster is meant to quickly grab the audience's attention and inform them of the activity. THe content should be attractive, short and succinct to achieve the best outcome. **DO NOT CRAM AN ESSAY INTO A POSTER. NOBODY IS GONNA WASTE TIME READING THE ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT.**
- Refer to the How To Publish a Poster guide to see how to get your completed poster approved for display.
